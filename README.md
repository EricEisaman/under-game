A simple game rendered on a single quad with GLSL. The code tries to strike a pragmatic balance functional and OO styles and use minimal dependencies. It was largely an excuse for me to experiment with creating pretty graphics via a pixel shader, and to experiment with some architecture ideas. It was an approximately 10 day project (though I've done some minor tweaking and added sounds after the initial 10 day burst).
